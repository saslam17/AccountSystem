# AccountSystem

I have used JavaEE to create my account system and tried linking it to a front end and encountered many errors. I tried using Angular JS for the front end and haven't managed to get my head around this topic. I did however try and switch to using Springboot and cover the tutorials on pluralsight but havn't managed to complete this in time. Overall, i found Springboot a lot more user friendly.
